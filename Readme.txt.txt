There are two folders:
1. Talon sector pattern contains the dataset
2. System-level test has the algorithm for SIR calculation

In System-level test interference_mapping1 and 2 are the files which computes using the Talon sector patterns. main_CSMA is the file coded by Teng earlier for PIA. I used that file to evaluate the AP assignment.
